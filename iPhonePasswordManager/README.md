iPhonePasswordManager
=====================

For iOS 4.0

This iPhone application was designed to be a locally stored password manager. Passwords are only stored on the device inside of the application's documents directory. In this version no encryption is implemented for password storage. However, iOS read permissions only allow the application that owns the documents directory to read or write from it. So passwords are still kept confidential from other applications on the device. 

This repository is incomplete in the sense that a working build cannot be compiled from its files. It only contains code.
